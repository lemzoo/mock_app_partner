# Mocker l'application partenaire

1 - Installation

Installing in a virtual env is a good practice

virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 venv_mock
. ./venv/bin/activate
Actually install the dependancies

pip install -r requirements.txt

2 - Starting the server

Run with the flask embedded serveur (for test and debug)

```python -m server```

The server should run on the port 5009

3 - Configuring a SoapMock instance

```mocks.append(SoapMock('visabio', 'Call', 'visas', 2))```

arguments:
 - *Route
 - *Xpath to the variable searched in post soap payload
 - directory to response files ( =route if not set)
 - response time in seconds (0 by default)


you must put response files in `reponses/service_name/` dir.
variable.xml, `__default__.xml` if the file does not exist

4 - Routes

GET on /partenaires/list returns a list of configured mocks
```{
  "visabio": {
    "status": "enabled",
    "tag": "VisaStickerNumber",
    "directory": "responses/visabio",
    "response time": "0",
    "files": [
      "1234567890.xml",
      "__default__.xml"
    ]
  }
}
```

POST on /partenaires/<PARTNER>
return the xml file corresponding to the variable found if post payload
